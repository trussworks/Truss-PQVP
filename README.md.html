<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The following is a summary of the approach used by TrussWorks Inc. (Truss) to create the working prototype.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; line-height: 17.0px; font: 14.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>About us:</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Truss excels at building complex software infrastructure in high-compliance industries to deliver superior user experiences for our clients. We were a core part of the elite engineering team that fixed Healthcare.gov and built the Marketplace Lite application to enable a more efficient user signup experience, ultimately enabling 11M citizens to access healthcare for the first time. Silicon Valley startups, Fortune 200 corporations and US federal agencies recognize Truss for our uncanny discipline that enables us to ship product under severe constraints.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We are experts in customer research, DevOps, UX design and rapid iteration / agile techniques that accelerate development teams while reducing the risk of costly errors. Based in San Francisco and Oakland, the Truss team has decades of engineering and management leadership to both transform legacy systems and build core scalability for fast-growing startups. In short, our processes are as sustainable as our software..</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Truss leveraged human-centered design techniques to create the prototype design. The team worked collaboratively to develop multiple iterations of the prototype, incorporating feedback from interviews and usability testing.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; line-height: 17.0px; font: 14.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>Project organization:</b></span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Truss assigned one leader and gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted.</li>
  <li class="li5">Truss realizes that in order for work to move quickly through blockers that a decision maker needs to be identified who can be an authoritative driver where required. As an engineering driven organization, we chose the Technical Architect as this person. We understand that ownership requires being open to inputs from the team while being able to make informed decisions based on often-incomplete information.</li>
  <li class="li5">Truss engaged a multi-disciplinary and collaborative team to design and develop the prototype. We employ a model that everyone on the team should be able to fill multiple roles and all user stories should be handled by whichever team member becomes available. The following roles were held by one or more team members:</li>
  <li class="li5">Product Manager: Nic Wissman</li>
  <li class="li5">Technical Architect: Mark Ferlatte</li>
  <li class="li5">Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester: Nic Wissman, Jamie Kennedy, Breanne Boland</li>
  <li class="li5">Front End Web Developer: Emily Chen, Macrae Linton, Mark Ferlatte, Mojo Talantikite</li>
  <li class="li5">Backend Web Developer: Emily Chen, Macrae Linton, Mark Ferlatte, Mojo Talantikite, Mike Kania</li>
  <li class="li5">DevOps Engineer: Mike Kania, Mojo Talantikite, Mark Ferlatte</li>
  <li class="li5">Agile Coach: Nic Wissman, Mark Ferlatte</li>
  <li class="li5">Business Analyst: Nic Wissman, Jamie Kennedy, Macrae Linton</li>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The following human-centered design techniques were used:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">Frame your design challenge</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">Build a Team</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">Secondary Research</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">User Interviews</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">Expert Interviews</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">Usability Testing</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">People were included throughout the design process and their feedback incorporated into each iteration of the prototype.</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">Before we initiated any design or development, we went through the exercise of</span></li>
  <ul class="ul2">
    <li class="li4"><span class="s4">F</span><span class="s1">raming the challenge we were designing for as a question</span></li>
    <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">Identifying the impact, possible solutions, and constraints around this challenge</span></li>
    <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">Reframing the challenge based on the details identified.</span></li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">This allowed us to get a better understanding of the types of data we would need to collect during our research efforts.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">The team conducted secondary research by reviewing examples of notification tools which use similar features including Pagerduty and Hazard Alert.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">Fifteen interviews were conducted with citizens across multiple age, location, and gender demographics while designing the tool. The inputs from these interviews were used to inform and validate our design approach prior to any development activity.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">We white-boarded out the user flows and updated them based on research. Once we had all features defined we outlined the workflow and turned that into user stories.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">Regarding experts, we interviewed a NOAA employee as well as a firefighter to determine the types of folks who would send emergency notifications. We also interfaced with an employee of ArcGIS to get a better understanding of how the technology works.</span></li>
  <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">Usability testing</span></li>
  <ul class="ul2">
    <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">As a non-programmer within the team, the Product Manager, Nic Wissman, did continual usability testing and filed new user stories throughout the development process.</span></li>
    <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">Other team members also identified usability improvements and filed stories which were reviewed by the team and accepted or rejected during planning and grooming sessions.</span></li>
    <li class="li4"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s1">Additionally we conducted user testing with people within the organization but outside the assigned team to provide valuable feedback which was iterated upon to achieve the delivered prototype.</span></li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Design style guide: Neat was used as the grid system to ensure a consistent and responsive design. Templates and style guides were leveraged from the draft U.S. Web Design Standards site.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; line-height: 17.0px; font: 14.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>Agile development approach:</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The team conducted three one-week sprint cycles(link to pivotal board) to complete design, development, and testing. Several technologies were used to ensure the prototype works on multiple devices with a responsive design, including Neat, Leaflet, and React.js. All platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5">Modern and open-source technologies include: Docker, Circle CI, Postgres, React.js and Go.</li>
  <li class="li5">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) was run on AWS using: Terraform, ECS, RDS, WebPack, SNS, etc.</li>
  <li class="li5">Automated unit tests developed via: We used Jest and the Go built-in unit testing library;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li5">We did browser testing using Selenium and Sauce Labs to emulate different devices and OSs as well as accessed the prototype on iPhone/Android mobile OS.</li>
  <li class="li5">Continuous integration system: Circle CI</li>
  <li class="li5">Configuration management: Terraform</li>
  <li class="li5">Continuous monitoring: AWS Cloudwatch and Route53 Health Check</li>
  <li class="li5">Container deployment:ECS / Docker</li>
  <li class="li5"></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The architecture is a single page<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>JavaScript application with a Go API server. It is supported by a carefully selected set of modern libraries such as:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li9">React</li>
  <li class="li9">Flux</li>
  <li class="li9">Leaflet</li>
</ul>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Project management tools used include Pivotal Tracker, Slack, GitHub, and Zoom. The team used Pivotal Tracker to create a prioritized list of user stories and to track bugs and issues.</span></p>
